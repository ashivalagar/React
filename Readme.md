## Introduction
A very simple todo list application made using React.js. This is to serve as a starting point for your journey in creating beautiful client side applications using React.
### Getting Started
These instructions will help you get started in setting up your local environment to be able to build this application yourself.

#### Required Packages
You must already have a working copy of node and npm on your PC.
```
create-react-app
```
What create-react-app does for us, is give us a basic platform to start working on. Create-react-app takes care of downloading all the dependencies that we require to get started and also gives us some boiler plate code as well.

#### Installation
```npm i -g create-react-app```

## Creating Our First React App
As you might have already guessed. We are going to use the create-react-app package to set up our new react application.

Open up your terminal window and navigate to a desired project directory. Once you are inside the desired directory, run the following command:
```
create-react-app my-application
```
Replace "my-application" with whatever name you want to give your applcation. For this particular run through, I've named my application <strong>todo-list</strong>.

## Running Our App
After setting up the application, now we navigate to it as such:
```
cd my-application
```
To start our application up on a live server we run the command:
```
npm start
```
Once you run this, the following screen should pop up on your browser:

You can start making this project truly yours by editing the App.js file in the src directory -->
